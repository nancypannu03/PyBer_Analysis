# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of the Analysis

- In this project, we will be assisting a ride-sharing app company in order to analyze all the ride share data from January to early May of 2019 and create a compelling visualization for the CEO. 
- Skills used - Python, Pandas library, Matplotlib library

### Purpose

We will deal with two technical analyis outcomes:
 - A ride-sharing summary DataFrame by city type - In this part, we will be dealing with the Pandas's groupby(), count(), sum(), merge() functions in order to explore    the provided data and achieve the desired results.
 
 - A multiple-line chart of total fares for each city type - Finally, we will create multiple line chart by using the plot() function from the matplotlib library.


## Results: 
Using images from the summary DataFrame and multiple-line chart, describe the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types.
Ride-sharing data include the total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride and driver, and total fare by city type. 





## Summary:
Based on the results, provide three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types.
